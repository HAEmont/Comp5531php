# Comp5531php
This repo is set for php development for our final project.
In the first place, I have created two php files as GUI for our Warm-up project just to test the environment.
These files are accessible on the webserver of ENCS dep. of Concordia through putty and VPN if you are offcampus.
Meanwhile, I also transfered these files plus foo.php (testing php file for any server including the localhost).
